# Quick Start: Profile Updates

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ 1. Profile Changes Now Update Everywhere
**Problem:** When you changed your name in settings, old posts still showed your old name.

**Solution:** All pages now fetch the current name/class from your profile table when displaying posts/replies.

**Files Changed:**
- `app.js` - Homepage posts
- `post-detail.js` - Post details and replies  
- `saved.js` - Saved posts
- All now use: `user_profiles!posts_user_id_fkey(name, class)` in queries

### ✅ 2. Hover Cards Work Everywhere
**Problem:** Hover cards only worked on homepage.

**Solution:** Added hover card script and initialization to all pages.

**Files Changed:**
- `post-detail.html` - Added user-hover.js script
- `saved.html` - Added user-hover.js script
- `profile.html` - Added user-hover.js script
- All `.js` files now call `initializeUserHoverCards()` after loading content

### ✅ 3. UI Consistency
**Problem:** Some fonts/styles weren't consistent.

**Solution:** Verified all elements use consistent styling:
- Forms: 0.95rem font size
- Dropdowns: 0.9rem font size  
- Tabs: 0.95rem font size
- All already consistent!
