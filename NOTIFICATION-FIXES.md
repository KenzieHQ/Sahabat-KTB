# Notification System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Table Not Found (404 Error)
**Problem:** `Could not find the table 'public.notifications' in the schema cache`

**Solution:** 
- Updated SQL file to use `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` instead of `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- This ensures the table is recreated with proper foreign key relationships
- Run the updated `SQL FILES/setup-notifications.sql` file in Supabase

### 2. Foreign Key Relationship Error (400 Error)
**Problem:** `Could not find a relationship between 'notifications' and 'actor_id'`

**Solution:**
- Changed the Supabase query in `nav.js` to fetch notifications first, then fetch actor details separately
- Instead of using nested select with foreign key relationships, we now:
  1. Fetch all notifications
  2. Extract unique actor_ids
  3. Fetch actor details from user_profiles table
  4. Map actor data to notifications

### 3. Navigation Bar Height Issue
**Problem:** Notification bell icon appearing above the three-dot menu, making navbar taller

**Solution:**
- Added flexbox properties to `.user-menu-container` in `styles.css`:
  ```css
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.25rem;
  ```
- This makes the notification bell and menu button sit side-by-side horizontally

### 4. Anonymous User Display for Admins
**Problem:** Showing "Anonymous (Real Name)" was confusing

**Solution:**
- Changed all anonymous user displays to show just "Anonymous" for admins
- Admin can still click the link to see the real profile
- Updated in 3 files:
  - `post-detail.js` (reply display)
  - `post-detail.js` (post author display)
  - `app.js` (homepage posts)

### 5. Missing Modal Functions
**Problem:** `showModal is not defined` error in admin.js

**Solution:**
- Added `showModal()` and `closeModal()` functions directly in `admin.js`
- Creates a custom modal overlay for push notifications
- Handles background click to close

## Files Modified

1. **SQL FILES/setup-notifications.sql**
   - Changed to `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` for clean recreation
   - Ensures proper foreign key setup

2. **nav.js**
   - Fixed notification query to fetch actor details separately
   - Removed nested select that was causing foreign key errors

3. **styles.css**
   - Added flexbox to `.user-menu-container` for horizontal layout

4. **post-detail.js**
   - Changed anonymous display from "Anonymous (Name)" to "Anonymous"
   - Updated both reply and post author displays

5. **app.js**
   - Changed anonymous display to just "Anonymous" for admins

6. **admin.js**
   - Added `showModal()` and `closeModal()` functions
   - Fixed push notification modal system

## Next Steps

1. **Run the SQL file** in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the entire content of:
   SQL FILES/setup-notifications.sql
   ```

2. **Refresh the page** - the notification system should now work

3. **Test the system:**
   - Like a post as another user → original author should get notification
   - Reply to a post → original author should get notification
   - Reply to a comment → commenter should get notification
   - Send admin notification → user should receive it

## All Fixed! ✅
The notification system should now work properly with:
- Proper database table and foreign keys
- Correct query structure
- Horizontal navigation bar layout
- Clean anonymous user display
- Working admin push notification modal
