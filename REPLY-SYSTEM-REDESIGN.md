# Reply System Redesign

## Overview
The reply section has been completely redesigned to be clearer, more intuitive, and better aligned with the rest of the website's design aesthetic.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Cleaner Header Section**
- **Before**: Confusing trigger boxes and separate headings
- **After**: Clean header with reply count and a clear "Add Reply" button
- The section is always visible, making it clear where to interact
- Reply count dynamically updates: "Replies" or "Replies (X)"

### 2. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**
- **Main Replies**: White background with subtle borders
- **Nested Replies**: Light gray background to show hierarchy
- **Clear indentation**: Left border line shows nested structure
- **Hover effects**: Subtle border color and shadow changes on hover

### 3. **Better Action Buttons**
- **Larger icons**: More touch-friendly (18px for likes, 16px for replies)
- **Clear labels**: "Reply" text added back for clarity
- **Hover states**: Background color changes with smooth transitions
- **Consistent padding**: Better spacing for easier clicking

### 4. **Enhanced Nested Reply System**
- **Toggle button animation**: Arrow rotates 180Â° when expanded
- **Better visual feedback**: Active state shows when nested replies are visible
- **Clearer labels**: "Hide X replies" when expanded, "X replies" when collapsed
- **Flex layout**: Nested replies use proper flex column layout

### 5. **Improved Form Design**
- **Contained forms**: Forms are now in a light gray container
- **Better buttons**: "Post Reply" instead of just "Reply"
- **Consistent styling**: Uses btn-secondary for cancel buttons
- **Clear separation**: Border and padding separate form from content

### 6. **Delete Button Enhancement**
- **Larger icon**: 16px instead of 14px for better visibility
- **Better hover state**: Red background tint on hover
- **Better positioning**: Aligned properly in the header

### 7. **Responsive Design**
- **Mobile-friendly**: Stack elements on smaller screens
- **Flexible buttons**: "Add Reply" button goes full-width on mobile
- **Adjusted indentation**: Reduced margins on mobile devices

### 8. **Typography & Spacing**
- **Larger text**: 0.95rem for reply content (was 0.9rem)
- **Better line height**: 1.7 for improved readability
- **Generous padding**: 1.25rem in main replies, 1rem in nested
- **Clear gaps**: 1rem between replies, 0.875rem for nested

## Design Consistency
All styles now match the rest of the website:
- Uses CSS variables for colors
- Consistent border radius (8px for main, 6px for nested)
- Same transition speeds (0.2s ease)
- Matching button styles with proper hover states
- Consistent color scheme (blue accents, gray neutrals)

## User Experience Improvements
1. **No more confusion**: Reply section is always visible and clear
2. **Better feedback**: All interactive elements have hover states
3. **Clearer actions**: Buttons have descriptive labels
4. **Visual hierarchy**: Easy to distinguish main vs nested replies
5. **Smooth animations**: Subtle transitions for all state changes
6. **Mobile-optimized**: Works great on all screen sizes
